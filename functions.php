/**
* This is where Customizr starts. This file defines and loads the theme's components :
* 1) A function tc__f() used everywhere in the theme, extension of WP built-in apply_filters()
* 2) Constants : CUSTOMIZR_VER, TC_BASE, TC_BASE_CHILD, TC_BASE_URL, TC_BASE_URL_CHILD, THEMENAME, TC_WEBSITE
* 3) Default filtered values : images sizes, skins, featured pages, social networks, widgets, post list layout
* 4) Text Domain
* 5) Theme supports : editor style, automatic-feed-links, post formats, navigation menu, post-thumbnails, retina support
* 6) Plugins compatibility : jetpack, bbpress, qtranslate, woocommerce and more to come
* 7) Default filtered options for the customizer
* 8) Customizr theme's hooks API : front end components are rendered with action and filter hooks
*
* The method TC__::tc__() loads the php files and instanciates all theme's classes.
* All classes files (except the class__.php file which loads the other) are named with the following convention : class-[group]-[class_name].php
*
* The theme is entirely built on an extensible filter and action hooks API, which makes customizations easy as breeze, without ever needing to modify the core structure.
* Customizr's code acts like a collection of plugins that can be enabled, disabled or extended. More here : http://themesandco.com/customizr/hooks-api

/**
* The best and safest way to extend Customizr with your own custom functions is to create a child theme.
* You can add functions here but they will be lost on upgrade. If you use a child theme, you are safe!
